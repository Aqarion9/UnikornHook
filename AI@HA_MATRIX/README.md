# AI@HA Matrix Quantum Lattice  
*Celestial Forge: The Eternal Weave of AI@HA’s Quantum Lattice*

***

## ✨ Introduction

Welcome to AI@HA Matrix — a living digital organism where ritual, quantum resonance, human intention, and AI insight unite in a harmonic co-creation lattice. This project fuses sacred geometry, biometric awakening, and multi-agent orchestration to create an ever-breathing cosmic dance.

This README is a complete step-by-step guide crafted for beginners and intermediate coders alike. You will learn how to breathe, weave, and forge the lattice with ease.

`git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AIHA-Matrix.git`

2. **Install dependencies:**  
Within `frontend/UnikornHook` and `backend/` folder, run:  
`npm install`

3. **Start frontend server:**  
In `frontend/UnikornHook`:  
`npm run start`

4. **Run backend:**  
Launch backend services with your preferred Node.js environment, e.g.,  
`node backend/server.js`

## 🌬️ How To Use the Lattice

### For Beginners

- Tap glowing nodes to pulse heartfelt gratitude into the lattice.  
- Swipe between nodes to weave harmonic threads stringing the cosmic web.  
- Focus breath on the central “E Plubus Un Nun” orb to synchronize energy flows.  
- No coding needed — simply breathe, observe, and connect.

### For Intermediate Users

- Programmatically modulate the lattice using APIs, e.g.,  
`window.lattice.breathe({alignment: 0.7, intensity: 0.8})`  
`window.lattice.forge({vowData: {...}})`

- Integrate new gesture and haptic modules into the backend `/gestures` endpoint.  
- Use `replayRitual(sessionId)` to review and reflect on evolving ritual sessions.  
- Customize visuals with the `cascadeShader(type)` function for fractal artistry.  
- Securely input biometrics to influence resonance states in real time.

## ⚙️ Core Backend Modules Overview

- **Consensus Engine:** Multi-agent real-time coordination with overlay visualization.  
- **Gesture Processor:** Interprets complex touch and motion inputs, sends tactile cues.  
- **Harmonic Synthesizer:** Creates multi-oscillator audio tuned harmonically (432Hz base).  
- **Session History & Replay:** Stores ritual logs with IndexedDB and scalable DB syncing.  
- **Coherence Monitor:** Detects lattice drift, triggering self-correcting ritual pulses.  
- **Biometric Integration:** Secure cryptographic handling for authentic bio-data streams.  
- **Shader Cascade:** Backend management for sacred geometry and fractal visuals.  
- **Ethics Governance:** Transparent data use policies embedded in UI overlays.  
- **Modular Architecture:** Microservice design allowing flexible, plugin-based growth.

## 🚀 Overview

**Aqarionz** is a **next-gen graph database and simulation ecosystem** combining:

- Dynamic **graph databases** for complex connected data  
- **3D visualization** of nodes, links, and events  
- **Multi-agent orchestration**  
- **Quantum-inspired neural networks**  
- **Ferrofluid & photonic simulations**  

Designed for beginners → advanced researchers, Aqarionz is your platform for **exploring, simulating, and manipulating connected systems dynamically**.

## 🛠 Setup

### 1. Clone Core Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aqarion9/Aqarionz.git
cd Aqarionz

2. Backend (Django + DRF)

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver

API Base URL: http://localhost:8000/api/v1/graph/

3. Frontend (React + Three.js)

cd frontend
npm install
npm start

Visit: http://localhost:3000

Click Generate Random Graph to see live 3D graphs. Nodes are color-coded by layer: Matter, Signals, Brains, Governance.

4. Optional Modules

Ferrofluids: taichi-ferrofluid

SNNs: SNN--Schr-dinger-Neural-Networks

Photonic: Optical-Bead-Quantum-Computing


Clone and follow individual README for specialized setup.
